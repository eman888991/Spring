Let's say you have an application with two different implementations of a Shape interface
: Circle and Square. You want to inject one of these implementations into a Draw class.
In the Driver class, you will use @Autowired along with @Qualifier to
specify which Shape implementation to inject.
In this example, the @Qualifier("circle") annotation specifies that
the Circle implementation should be injected into the Draw class.
